## Project Description
The Order Management System is a Java Swing-based application designed to streamline the ordering process across multiple organizations within a single platform. Utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and data structures, this system aims to enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, and address security concerns associated with separate logins. Admins have the authority to create enterprises, manage analytics, and oversee the performance of enterprises, organizations, and delivery partners.

## Problem Statement
1. **Complicated Ordering Process**: Current delivery systems require users to navigate through multiple platforms, leading to inefficiency and increased costs.
2. **Security and Privacy**: The need for users to register and log in to multiple applications separately poses a potential security risk.
3. **High Operation Cost for Organizations**: Manual processes, resource inefficiencies, and suboptimal routing contribute to high operational costs for organizations.

## Proposed Solution
The Order Management System provides a unified platform for users to place orders seamlessly across multiple organizations. By consolidating orders and streamlining processes, organizations can significantly reduce operational costs. Additionally, the system enhances delivery efficiency by grouping multiple products for simultaneous delivery.

## Working Model
1. **Admin Functions**: 
   - Create enterprises and delivery partners.
   - Access analytics within the system.
2. **Enterprise Functions**: 
   - Create and manage organizations.
3. **Organization Functions**: 
   - Add or remove products according to business needs.
4. **Delivery Partner Functions**: 
   - Accept orders placed by customers for delivery.
5. **Customer Functions**: 
   - Sign up and log in to place orders.

## Tech Stack
